Respite is in development — no features have shipped yet. The player-experience
promise lives in [`design/VISION.md`](design/VISION.md), the behavioral contract
in [`design/SPEC.md`](design/SPEC.md); this page will describe features as they
ship. The website is [respite.rfizzle.com](https://respite.rfizzle.com).
